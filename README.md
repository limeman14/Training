## Training

### Welcome to my practice repository! 
It contains simple programs which were written during my online courses (Skillbox) studying. Each folder contains a module with a specific problem solved, e.g. Moscow Metro Station Parser, etc.

#### Short projects descriptions:
- **BankCSV** - parcer of CSV bank statement of "AlfaBank", RU. Prints the total amount of income and expenses, divided by categories according to their descriptions
- **MosMetro** - parcer of stations list of Moscow Metro on [wikipedia.org](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Список_станций_Московского_метрополитена) page. Creates JSON file containing information about stations and lines, also parces it backwards to count stations on each line
- **SPBMetro** - parces JSON file, containing information about stations and lines of Saint Petersburg Metro, calculating duration and route from one station to another (including interchanges). Contains unit tests.
- **SiteMap** - creates sitemap (example includes skillbox.ru) in multithreading mode (fork-join pool API)

This repository will be complemented in future.
